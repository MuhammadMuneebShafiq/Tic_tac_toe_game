    "<h2>Introduction to Minimax Algorithm in Solving Tic Tac Toe</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence and game theory. It is used to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as \"maximin\"â€”to maximize the minimum gain.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In the context of the Tic Tac Toe game, the Minimax algorithm helps in finding the optimal move for the player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes, and then chooses the move that maximizes the player's chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The basic idea of the Minimax algorithm is to simulate all possible moves in the game, evaluate the resulting game states, and choose the move that leads to the best outcome. The algorithm works by recursively exploring all possible moves, and at each step, it assumes that the opponent will also play optimally.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The Minimax algorithm can be enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning, which reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by eliminating branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. This optimization makes the algorithm more efficient and faster, especially for games with larger search spaces.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In summary, the Minimax algorithm is a powerful tool for solving the Tic Tac Toe problem by ensuring that the player makes the best possible move at each step, considering the opponent's optimal responses.</p>"

    "\n",
    "<p>In the context of the Tic Tac Toe game, Alpha-Beta Pruning helps in finding the optimal move for the player by eliminating branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. This is achieved by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of, respectively.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The basic idea of Alpha-Beta Pruning is to stop evaluating a move when it is found that it cannot possibly influence the final decision. This is done by comparing the current node's value with alpha and beta values and pruning the branches that do not need to be explored further.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>By incorporating Alpha-Beta Pruning into the Minimax algorithm, we can significantly reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, leading to faster and more efficient decision-making. This optimization is particularly useful for games like Tic Tac Toe, where the search space can be large, and evaluating all possible moves can be computationally expensive.</p>\n",
